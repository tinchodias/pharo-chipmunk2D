# pharo-chipmunk2D
Bindings from Pharo to Chipmunk2D library via uFFI




## Install

##Â Build C library

The objective of this step is to have the library in a directory named Chipmunk2D in the image directory. You can follow http://chipmunk-physics.net/release/ChipmunkLatest-Docs/ but we reproduce it below step by step.

First, download and unzip https://github.com/slembcke/Chipmunk2D/archive/Chipmunk-7.0.3.zip in a directory named Chipmunk2D.

Alternatively, you can git clone with:
```
git clone git@github.com:slembcke/Chipmunk2D.git --tag Chipmunk-7.0.3
```

Second, cd to the library root directory and execute in command-line:
```
    cmake -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS='-DCHIPMUNK_FFI' .
```

At the end, it should show something like:

```
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: /Users/tinchodias/d/pharo/chipmunk/Chipmunk2D
```

Then, execute:

```
make
```

Should show something like:

```
[ 34%] Linking C static library libchipmunk.a
[ 34%] Built target chipmunk_static
...
[ 69%] Linking C shared library libchipmunk.dylib
[ 69%] Built target chipmunk
...
[100%] Linking C executable chipmunk_demos
[100%] Built target chipmunk_demos
```

You can try demos with:

```
./demo/chipmunk_demos
```
